Create a new module that handles updating cards *in place* when the edit form is used.

When a card is edited, the form will be submitted with the todoId, we will use this todoId
to querySelect the existing article element and update it's child elements with the form data.

This means we need to not call the UPDATE_DISPLAY event on form submission, but rather
call an UPDATE_CARD event when the todoId field is filled on form submission.

This new updateCard module will listen for this event, and handle it from there.
